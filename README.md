Jekyll-Template
===============

This is the template, without posts, for my personal site. Most of the heavy lifting is done by [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), but perhaps it will be useful to some people.

Notable diffs from [Tom Preston-Werner's canonical Jekyll template](http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com) include:

* Bootstrap-based layouts
* Index that puts recent posts on the front page
* Rackup file, intended for easy development using [Pow](http://pow.cx)
* Picture of me smiling included with every clone
